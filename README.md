==========================
ðŸ“˜ What This Script Does
==========================
This Python script demonstrates how to use **Regular Expressions (regex)** to extract useful data from a block of unstructured text. It simulates processing raw data from an API or scraped webpage and focuses on **identifying and extracting four key types of information**:

1. **Email Addresses** â€“ such as `user@example.com`
2. **URLs** â€“ web links starting with `http://` or `https://`
3. **Phone Numbers** â€“ in formats like `(123) 456-7890` or `123-456-7890`
4. **Credit Card Numbers** â€“ formatted with spaces, dashes, or as one long number

ðŸ“¥ Input
-------
The script contains a sample block of text with both **valid** and **invalid** examples for each data type, to test how accurately the regular expressions identify the correct formats.

ðŸ“¤ Output
--------
When you run the script, it will print out lists of all valid matches found in the sample text, grouped by data type. Invalid formats will be ignored.

âœ… What You Can Expect
----------------------
- The script filters out incorrect formats automatically using regex.
- Itâ€™s easy to expand if you want to add more data types like:
  - Time formats (e.g., `14:30` or `2:30 PM`)
  - Hashtags (e.g., `#MyTag`)
  - HTML tags (e.g., `<div>`)
  - Currency (e.g., `$19.99`)
